```I wanna be the very best,
Like no one ever was.
To build them is my real test,
To deploy them is my cause.

I will travel across the Gitlab.
Searching far and wide.
Each Repo to understand
The power that's inside

Repo, (gotta build them all) its you and me
I know Its my destiny
Repo, oh, you're my best friend
In a world we must defend

Repo, (gotta build them all) a heart so true
Our courage will pull us through
You teach me and I'll teach you
(Re-po) Gotta build 'em all

Every challenge along the way
With courage I will face
I will battle every day
To claim my rightful place

Come with me, the time is right
There's no better team
Arm in arm we'll win the fight
It's always been our dream
```
